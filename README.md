# Hermione, Will You Marry Me?

A magical, Hogwarts-inspired proposal webpage that blends the charm of the Wizarding World with cutting-edge prompting techniques using [Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-Artifacts](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-Artifacts) on [hugging face](https://huggingface.co/qamarsidd).

## Prompt I have used:
```bash
   I’d like you to create a romantic web page to propose to my girlfriend, [Hermione]. The page should ask, ‘Will you marry me?’ with two buttons: ‘Yes’ and ‘No.’

If she clicks ‘Yes,’ display a message saying, ‘Thank you! I’m coming with flowers!’
If she tries to click ‘No,’ the button should move to a different spot, making it impossible to select.

The background should have a romantic, celebratory Hogwarts vibe (take the image from this url=optional), like a magical evening celebration. Also, limit the screen size to avoid too much scrolling.
